🔍 Malware Detection Using Image Classification
🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to our malware detection project! This project leverages deep learning and image classification techniques to detect malware. We utilize the VGG16 model to classify virus files. Our dataset is sourced from the theZoo repository, providing a diverse range of real-world malware samples for training.

🕵️‍♂️ Meet Detective M
Say hello to Detective M, our project's digital mascot! Detective M embodies our commitment to uncovering and neutralizing malware threats with sharp investigative skills and a touch of personality.

🤖 Detective M Chatbot
We've brought Detective M to life as a chatbot, powered by the Llama3 open-source platform. The chatbot assists users while sharing Detective M's investigative flair.

🔧 Data Preprocessing
Virus files are first converted into binary format, then transformed into images. This step allows us to harness the power of convolutional neural networks for malware detection.

🧠 Model Architecture
Our model is based on VGG16, a proven CNN architecture in image classification. We've fine-tuned it specifically for malware image classification to achieve optimal results.

📊 Evaluation
After training, our model achieved an impressive 93% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating the strength of our approach in detecting malware through visual representations.
