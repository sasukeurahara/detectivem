🔍 Malware Detection using Image Classification Read-Me

Project Overview
Welcome to our malware detection project! This project focuses on using image classification techniques powered by deep learning to detect malware. We utilize the VGG16 model for classifying virus files. Our dataset is sourced from 'theZoo' repository, providing a diverse range of malware samples for training.

🕵️‍♂️ Detective M Mascot
Meet Detective M, our project's mascot! Detective M embodies our commitment to uncovering and neutralizing malware threats.

🤖 Detective M Chatbot
We've integrated Detective M's personality into our chatbot using the Llama3 open-source platform. Our chatbot not only assists users but also shares Detective M's keen investigative spirit.

Data Preprocessing
We've converted virus files into binary format and then transformed them into images. This preprocessing step prepares the data for input into the VGG16 model.

Model Architecture
Our model architecture is based on VGG16, a convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. We fine-tuned the model to suit our malware detection objectives.

Evaluation
After training our model, we achieved an impressive accuracy of 93% on our test dataset. This showcases the efficacy of our approach in detecting malware from image representations of binary files.
