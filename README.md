  <h1 class="emoji">🔍 Malware Detection Using Image Classification</h1>

  <h2>🚀 Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to our malware detection project! This project leverages <strong>deep learning</strong> and 
    <strong>image classification</strong> techniques to detect malware. We utilize the <strong>VGG16</strong> model 
    to classify virus files. Our dataset is sourced from the 
    <a href="https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo" target="_blank">theZoo repository</a>, 
    providing a diverse range of real-world malware samples for training.
  </p>

  <h2>🕵️‍♂️ Meet Detective M</h2>
  <p>
    Say hello to <strong>Detective M</strong>, our project's digital mascot! Detective M embodies our commitment 
    to uncovering and neutralizing malware threats with sharp investigative skills and a touch of personality.
  </p>

  <h2>🤖 Detective M Chatbot</h2>
  <p>
    We've brought Detective M to life as a <strong>chatbot</strong>, powered by the 
    <strong>Llama3 open-source platform</strong>. The chatbot assists users while sharing Detective M's 
    investigative flair.
  </p>

  <h2>🔧 Data Preprocessing</h2>
  <p>
    Virus files are first converted into binary format, then transformed into images. This step allows us to 
    harness the power of <strong>convolutional neural networks</strong> for malware detection.
  </p>

  <h2>🧠 Model Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    Our model is based on <strong>VGG16</strong>, a proven CNN architecture in image classification. 
    We've fine-tuned it specifically for malware image classification to achieve optimal results.
  </p>

  <h2>📊 Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    After training, our model achieved an impressive <strong>93% accuracy</strong> on the test dataset, 
    demonstrating the strength of our approach in detecting malware through visual representations.
  </p>
